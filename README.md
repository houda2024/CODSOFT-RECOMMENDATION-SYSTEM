# Recommendation System Project

This project is designed to build a simple yet effective **Recommendation System** using collaborative filtering techniques. The system recommends movies to users based on their preferences by analyzing user-movie interactions. This system leverages the MovieLens dataset for the recommendation process.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a **collaborative filtering-based recommendation system** that suggests movies to users based on their historical ratings of other movies. We use the MovieLens dataset, which contains ratings data from various users for different movies.

The system performs the following key steps:
1. **Data Loading & Exploration**: Load and analyze the dataset.
2. **Preprocessing**: Prepare the data for collaborative filtering.
3. **Model Selection & Training**: Implement item-based collaborative filtering using KNNBasic.
4. **Evaluation**: Assess the performance of the recommendation system using RMSE and MAE.
5. **Recommendations**: Provide top movie recommendations for a user.

## Dataset

We use the **MovieLens** dataset, which consists of the following files:
- **`ratings.csv`**: Contains user ratings for different movies.
- **`movies.csv`**: Contains movie titles and genres.
- **`tags.csv`**: Tags applied by users to various movies.
- **`genome_scores.csv` & `genome_tags.csv`**: Represent additional movie information, but are not used in this project.

You can download the dataset from [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) or other sources if needed.

### Dataset Files:
- `ratings.csv`: **userId**, **movieId**, **rating**, **timestamp**
- `movies.csv`: **movieId**, **title**, **genres**
- Additional data: `tags.csv`, `genome_scores.csv`, `genome_tags.csv` (not used in this task)
